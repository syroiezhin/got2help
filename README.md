### I am working on this project, please be patient, I will reach the result soon ...

- [x] Due to the fact that I have a MAC OS M1, I need to do this in the terminal:
'''bash
LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix portaudio)/lib" CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix portaudio)/include" pip install pyaudio
'''
- [x] To make sure that everything works, you can find out the downloaded version in this way:
'''bash
pip show PyAudio
'''
- [x] To check for performance with audio using the speech_recognition package, download by command:
'''bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
'''
- [x] Сheck if downloaded:
'''bash
pip show SpeechRecognition
'''
